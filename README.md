This HTML5 video player is build with **HTML5**,**CSS3** & vanilla **JAVASCRIPT**.tested on Chrome (both Android & Desktop), Firefox (Desktop).

##### Some Handy Shortcuts includes

- F (to Enter fullscreen mode)
- Esc (for leaving fullscreen mode)
- Space (for toggling play/pause)
- M (for toggling video sound)

Firefox browsers by default show picture-in-picture option on the right side of each video so custom picture-in-picture button is removed for firefox and also for android.
